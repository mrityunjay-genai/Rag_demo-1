The 2025 India–Pakistan conflict was a brief armed conflict between India and Pakistan that began on 7 May 2025, after India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, in a military campaign codenamed Operation Sindoor.[a] India said that the operation was in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir on 22 April 2025 in which 26 civilians were killed.[6][7][8] India accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Pakistan denied.

On 7 May, India launched Operation Sindoor with missile strikes on terrorism-related infrastructure facilities of Pakistan-based militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, and said that no Pakistani military or civilian facilities were targeted.[9][10] According to Pakistan, the Indian strikes hit civilian areas, including mosques, and resulted in civilian casualties. Following these strikes, there were border skirmishes and drone strikes between the two countries. Pakistan's army retaliated on 7 May, by launching a blitz of mortar shells on Jammu, particularly Poonch, killing civilians,[11] and damaging homes and religious sites.[12] This conflict marked the first drone battle between the two nuclear-armed nations.[13]

In the early hours of 10 May, India accused Pakistan of launching missile attacks on Indian air bases[14] including the Sirsa air base[15] while Pakistan accused India of launching attacks on several Pakistan air bases,[14][16] including Nur Khan air base, Rafiqi air base, and Murid air base.[14][17] As conflict escalated on 10 May, Pakistan launched its Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos,[b] in which it said it had targeted several Indian military bases, including Udhampur air base, Pathankot air base and Adampur air base.[21]

After the four-day military conflict, both India and Pakistan announced that a ceasefire had been agreed after a hotline communication between their DGMOs (Directors General of Military Operations) on 10 May 2025.[22][23] US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held extensive correspondence with both Indian and Pakistani officials during the negotiations. The ceasefire has been holding with resumed commercial flights and normalcy reported from both countries.[24][25]

Background
Further information: 2025 Pahalgam attack and 2025 India–Pakistan crisis
The Kashmir conflict, ongoing since 1947, has fuelled multiple wars and skirmishes between India and Pakistan over the disputed region.[26]

On 22 April 2025, a terrorist attack by five armed terrorists near Pahalgam in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu tourists.[27][28] The Resistance Front, a militant faction of the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, operating in Indian-administered Kashmir,[29][30][31] initially claimed responsibility for the attack,[32] but later denied responsibility, saying that the earlier claim was the result of a coordinated hacking,[33] and attributed the breach to Indian authorities.[34] Pakistan alleged that the Pahalgam attack was a "false flag operation" orchestrated by India.[35][36]

India announced a series of retaliatory measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, prompting responsive measures and leading to a diplomatic crisis and border skirmishes.[37][38][39] India and Pakistan also closed their airspaces for each other's airlines.[40] On 30 April, Pakistan claimed that a military strike by India was imminent.[41][42]

7 May
On 7 May 2025, India announced that it had launched missile and air strikes, codenamed Operation Sindoor,[a] targeting nine sites across Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir and Pakistan's Punjab province.[43][44][45] Seven targets, including some in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, were struck by the Indian Army's artillery regiment using precision long-range M982 Excalibur rounds and loitering munitions, while air defence was jointly provided by the Army and the Indian Air Force.[46] The Israeli press mentioned Indo-Israeli SkyStriker loitering munitions.[47][48] The attacks on targets in Pakistani Punjab were carried out by the Indian Air Force. According to sources cited by India Today, Rafale jets were employed, equipped with SCALP missiles and AASM Hammer bombs.[49] According to a working paper written by Christopher Clary for Stimson Center, BrahMos cruise missiles might have also been used.[50]

The Indian government described the strikes as "focused, measured, and non-escalatory".[51] Indian military spokespeople said that the missile strikes targeted infrastructure linked to the terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HuM),[10][52] and that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted,[53] with the locations selected to avoid damage to civilian infrastructure.[54] The missile strikes targeted locations including Subhan Allah Mosque in Bahawalpur (near Ahmedpur East) and Markaz-e-Taiba in Muridke, part of the headquarters of JeM and the headquarters of LeT respectively and alleged by India to be their terrorist training camps.[55][c] Other sites claimed to have been targetted by India included Abbas Mosque (associated with the JeM) in Kotli District, Shawai Nala camp (associated with the LeT) and Syedna Bilal Mosque (associated with the JeM) in Muzaffarabad,[55][52] a site in Gulpur, Kotli District (alleged by the Indian government to be a LeT and HuM camp);[58][54][59][60] Markaz Ahl-e-Hadith in Barnala, Bhimber District (alleged by the Indian government to be associated with the LeT);[60][59] a site in Mehmona Joya, Kotli Loharan West, Sialkot District (alleged by the Indian government to be a HuM camp);[60][58][59] and a site in Tera Katlan in Sarjal, Shakargarh Tehsil, Sialkot District (alleged by the Indian government to be a JeM camp).[60][54][59][58] India later showed satellite images purportedly showing damage at the targetted sites.[61]

According to a Pakistani security source, approximately 125 Indian and Pakistani fighter jets engaged in the aerial dogfight after the Indian air strikes on 7 May, exchanging long-range missile fire in a confrontation that lasted over an hour.[62] According to The Daily Telegraph, neither Pakistani nor Indian aircraft crossed the border, engaging instead in a "stand-off" conflict at a distance of more than 100 km at times.[63] Pakistan claimed that during the dogfight it had downed five Indian aircraft including three Rafales, one MiG-29, one SU-30MKI and a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle.[64] On 15 May, Pakistani prime minister Shehbaz Sharif claimed that Pakistan shot down six Indian fighter jets, the sixth being a Mirage 2000.[65] On 28 May, he again said that six Indian fighter jets were downed but said that four of these were Rafale, one MiG-29 and one "another plane".[66][67][68] On 6 June, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) said that No. 15 Squadron, also known as the Cobras, was responsible for shooting down six Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter jets. Operating out of PAF Base Minhas in Kamra with J-10C multirole fighters equipped with PL-15 beyond-visual-range missiles, the squadron claimed to have downed three Rafales, a MiG-29, a Mirage-2000, and a Su-30MKI. According to Dawn, the Cobras deployed 18 out of the 20 aircraft assigned to the squadron for the intercept operation on 7 May.[69]

A French intelligence official told CNN that an Indian Rafale was downed by Pakistan, though the French military did not comment.[70] Later, Chief of Staff of the French Air and Space Force Général d'armée aérienne Jérôme Bellanger [fr] stated that he had "seen evidence" of three aircraft being downed including a Rafale, a Mirage 2000 and a Russian Sukhoi.[71] Reuters reported that unnamed Indian government sources said that three fighter jets had crashed in India due to unknown causes.[72] On 8 May, an unnamed US official told Reuters that he assessed with "high confidence" that Pakistani J-10 aircraft had shot down at least two Indian fighter jets; a second official assessed one of the downed jets to be a Dassault Rafale.[73] The Washington Post later said that it had identified 3 crash sites in India from 7 May, identifying two of them as belonging to an Indian Dassault Rafale and Dassault Mirage 2000 at Akalia Kalan in Bathinda and Wuyan in Pampore respectively and another site at Akhnoor (likely an Indian MiG-29).[74][75][50] The Rafale crash in Bathinda also reportedly killed two bystanders.[76][77] On 9 May, local government sources in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir told Reuters that three fighter jets crashed in India on 7 May with three pilots being hospitalized.[78] On 11 May, while responding to a question on whether the force suffered losses, the Indian Airforce said that "losses are a part of combat" but declined to provide information on whether any losses had occurred.[79] According to a working paper written by Christopher Clary for Stimson Center, there was credible evidence that up to four Indian aircraft may indeed have been shot down during the encounter.[50] On 31 May 2025, India's Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted that India lost jets, but dismissed Pakistan's claim of downing six fighter jets.[80] On 18 July 2025, President of the United States Donald Trump said that he believed five aircraft had been shot down during the conflict.[81]

Pakistan confirmed strikes on six of the sites targetted by India, denying the strikes at Barnala and Gulpur in Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, but said these were civilian areas including mosques and residential areas and were not terrorist facilities.[43][56][55] The Pakistani government condemned them as an "act of war" that resulted in civilian casualties.[51] Shehbaz Sharif convened a meeting of the National Security Council to coordinate retaliatory strikes. The NSC declared that Pakistan "reserves the right to respond, in self-defence, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing."[82] Sharif gave the Pakistani army, under Asim Munir, the right to respond in any way needed.[83]
